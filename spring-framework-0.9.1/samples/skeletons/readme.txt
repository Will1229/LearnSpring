-- Spring application skeletons --
@author Juergen Hoeller

This directory contains application skeletons for various scenarios,
each in its own subdirectory. Those are not executable apps but just
intended as configuration showcases that can serve as starting point
for custom projects. All config files are extensively documented.

For further details on the mentioned framework classes, consult the
Spring Javadocs in the /docs/api directory. The class descriptions
do not only present the respective features, they also give usage
hints and illustrate general best practices.

Note that the sample application classes in the "example" package
that are mentioned in the config files are not included, as those
definitions just serve as configuration blueprints. Some hints
on how they might be implemented are given in the comments.
